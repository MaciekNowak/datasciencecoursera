### Basic Terms

* **deduction** A process of reasoning that moves from the general to the specific, in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the premises presented, so that the conclusion cannot be false if the premises are true.

* **deductive inference (reasoning)** 
  1. inference in which the conclusion is of no greater generality than the premises
  2. inference in which the conclusion is just as certain as the premises

* **induction** Derivation of general principles from specific instances. A method of proof of a theorem by first proving it for a specific case (often an integer; usually 0 or 1) and showing that, if it is true for one case then it must be true for the next.

* **inductive inference (reasoning)** Unlike deductive arguments, inductive reasoning allows for the possibility that the conclusion is false, even if all of the premises are true. Instead of being valid or invalid, inductive arguments are either strong or weak, which describes how probable it is that the conclusion is true.

* **infer** To introduce (something) as a reasoned conclusion; to conclude by reasoning or deduction, as from premises or evidence.

* **inference** The act or process of inferring by deduction or induction, reasoning.

* **negative predictive value (NPV)** is the proportions of negative results in statistics and diagnostic tests that are true negative results. The NPV describes the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic.

* **positive predictive value (PPV)** is the proportion of positive results in statistics and diagnostic tests that are true positive results. The PPV describes the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic.

* **premise** A proposition previously supposed or proved; something previously stated or assumed as the basis of further argument; a condition; a supposition.

* **sensitivity** The proportion of individuals in a population that will be correctly identified in a binary classification test.

* **specificity** The probability, in a binary test, of a true negative being correctly identified.

* **statistical inference (reasoning)** Drawing conclusions about a population from a random sample drawn from it, or, more generally, about a random process from its observed behavior during a finite period of time.
